** Show Epkg information in completion annotations

Out of the box [[https://github.com/minad/marginalia][Marginalia]] enriches package completion with
information from the built-in package manager.  This packages
teaches it to additionally use the [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/epkgs][Epkgs]] database, and if the
[[https://github.com/emacscollective/borg][Borg]] package manager is available, then it uses information
provided by that as well.
